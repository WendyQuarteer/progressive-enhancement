<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer
    said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in
    the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
    broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

<blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
    tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<br>

<p>Conclusion
    Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
    not make a big deal out of it...
